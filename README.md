# Dynamic-Systems-Modeling-and-Simulation
## This repository consists of assignments that I was able to take on the course of "Dynamic Systems Modeling and Simulation". 

In Chapter A, two different systems were given to simulate, one concerning a body-spring-damper system. The system A is shown below. The second topic (system B) was about a circuit given, all the necessary equations describing the 
circuit's behavior are implemented. For both systems:
- Theoretical analysis was made, implementing the differential equations describing the overall system
- Generated graphs , system's A position and velocity, and for system B Estimation of system output , investigation of estimates in case of errors 
- Following detailed shown steps for Least-squares algorithm
