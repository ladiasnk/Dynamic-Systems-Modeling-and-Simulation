# Dynamic-Systems-Modeling-and-Simulation
## This repository consists of assignments that I was able to take on the course of "Dynamic Systems Modeling and Simulation". 
### There are detailed reports in Greek, but the systems and the Math are universally readable of course, you can get the idea of the assignment by the analysis itself, although the reports are written in Greek.
#### Chapter A
In Chapter A, two different systems were given to simulate, one concerning a body-spring-damper system and one electrical circuit. Both systems are shown below shown below. The second topic (system B) was about a circuit given, all the necessary equations describing the 
circuit's behavior are implemented. For both systems:
- Theoretical analysis was made, implementing the differential equations describing the overall system
- Generated graphs , system's A position and velocity, and for system B Estimation of system output , investigation of estimates in case of errors 
- Following detailed shown steps for Least-squares algorithm

For System B, voltages Vr and Vc were generated from the given file v.p. To access the values you can use:

Vr= Vout(1),Vc=Vout(2)

### Chapter B
In Chapter B, the purpose of the lab exercise was to estimate with on line techniques unkown parameters using gradient method and Lyapunov method. Recognition systems were analyzed for both methods, mathematical theoretical analyses for the given system were performed in detail, and their simulation in Matlab. Finally, a modeling of a recognition system with the parallel topology of the Lyapunov method for a second-order system was performed. More details on the report of this second assignment itself.
